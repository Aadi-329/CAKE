Step 1 – Making the Batter

1. First grease a round baking pan of 7.5 inches diameter x 2 inches height with oil. Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit) for 15 minutes.

2. Sieve 1 cup whole wheat flour (you can also use all-purpose flour) and 3 tablespoons cocoa powder. Use good quality cocoa powder. Keep a plate or tray below the sieve.

6.In another pan or bowl, take ¾ cup sugar. I have used raw unrefined cane sugar, however regular white sugar can also be used. Add 1 cup cold water. The water has to be cold and chilled.

7. Stir with a small whisk till the sugar dissolves.

8. Now add ¼ cup oil. I added sunflower oil. I would not suggest adding butter as a few readers did tell me that the butter solidifies and it becomes difficult to get it to a homogenous mixture.

9. Stir briskly so that everything is mixed well.

10. It should be a homogenous mixture.

11. Next add 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Stir again. You could even use 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar or white vinegar in place of lemon juice.

12. Now add ½ teaspoon vanilla extract. You can also add chocolate extract or chocolate essence instead of vanilla.

16. There should be no lumps in the chocolate cake batter. The batter is slightly thin and not thick.

Step 2: Baking Chocolate Cake
17. Pour the chocolate cake batter into the prepared cake pan.

18. Tap the sides so that the extra air bubbles are let out.

19. Bake the eggless chocolate cake in a preheated oven for 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit) for 35 to 40 mins. Since temperatures vary from oven to oven be sure to keep an eye on it. Do not open the oven door many times. Only open it after three-fourth of the baking is done.

For baking in a convection mode of a microwave oven, preheat the oven to 180 degrees celsius (355 degrees Fahrenheit) for 15 minutes. Then bake the cake at 180 degrees celsius (355 degrees Fahrenheit) for 30 to 35 minutes.

20. For doneness check the cake with a bamboo skewer or toothpick. The bamboo skewer should come out clean. Once the eggless chocolate cake becomes warm or cools down, remove and place it on a wired rack. If the toothpick is sticky with the batter, then place the chocolate cake back in the oven and continue to bake for some more minutes. Before frosting, let the chocolate cake cool completely.
